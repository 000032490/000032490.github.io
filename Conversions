When we want to convert a value into another, eg: converting pounds into dollars as a currency, we have to declare them both as constants as what they are currently valued right now.
For Example:
```csharp
double PoundsToDollarsRate;
PoundsToDollarsRate = 1.67;

double DollarsToPoundsRate;
DollarsToPoundsRate = 0.59;
```
Of which we have declared their values as a constant, as shown above with Pounds to Dollars and Dollars to Pounds
When we try and convert them in this program, we can either use a switch case or an if statement to decide which conversion to do, in this case we'll use if statements:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Enter 1 for Pounds or 2 for Dollars");
int option = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
double FinalValue;
if (option == 1)
{
   FinalValue = ConvertValue * DollarsToPoundsRate;
   Console.WriteLine(ConvertValue + " Dollars is " + FinalValue + " Pounds");
}
if (option == 2)
{
    FinalValue = ConvertValue * PoundsToDollarsRate;
    Console.WriteLine(ConvertValue + " Pounds is " + FinalValue + " Dollars");
}
```
ConvertValue in this case is just an integer that records the monetary value which the user has inputed that he wants to convert, either being pounds or dollars.
